# Labyrinth Solver

The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking, implemented with a stack. The path is stored in a stack (path), where the algorithm moves through the maze by visiting neighboring rooms until the goal is reached or backtracking steps are necessary.

The path is calculated and displayed all at once when the 'solve' button is clicked, without animation. The backtracking process is not shown; only the final path is displayed.

Here a labyrinth is being solved by the DFS rule:
